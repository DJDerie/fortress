The first prototype of Fortress AI

Fortress AI uses NLP, GANs, and CNNs to detect and identify faces by generating photorealistic images. Right now, we are working on our first working prototype

Fortress uses NLP to understand and extract key facial features, which is then fed to the GAN

The GAN would then generate photorealistic images based on aforementioned characteristics

State of the art facial recognition algorithm would then identify and classify image as a specific person
